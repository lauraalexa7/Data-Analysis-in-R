# Data-Analysis-in-R
The various files in this project involve
data mining, transformation, and analysis in R using diamonds, housing, and sales data sets.
This includes cleaning (removing NULL values) and transforming (renaming or converting values)
data, as well as joining data sets and examining statistics by performing T-tests.
Graphical representations (bar chart, scatterplot, linear model) are utilized to explore
patterns and correlations between variables in the databases.
