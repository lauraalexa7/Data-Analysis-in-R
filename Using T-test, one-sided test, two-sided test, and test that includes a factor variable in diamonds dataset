# of price based on Color
# D = worst, J = best
# A two-tailed test will test both if the mean is 
# significantly greater than x and if the mean is significantly 
# less than x. The mean is considered significantly 
# different from x if the test statistic is in the top 2.5% 
# (if using significance level of 0.05)
# or bottom 2.5% of its probability distribution,
# resulting in a p-value less than 0.05. 


# filter the best and worst colored diamonds, 
# then perform t-test to determine 
# a significant difference in price based on the quality of color

# Null hypothesis = no statistically significant difference
# difference in means of the two sets of values

# of there being no difference betweensets of values is rejected
# This is a statistically significant result and the confidence interval does not contain zero,

# significance level of .05, a one-tailed test allots all of your 
# alpha to testing the statistical significance in the one 
# direction of interest.  This means that .05 is in one tail
# of the distribution of your test statistic. When using a 
# one-tailed test, you are testing for the possibility of the 
# relationship in one direction and completely
# disregarding the possibility of a relationship in the other direction.


# This one-sided test has only one rejection region, in the the
# upper tail of the distribution of the difference in group means.
# The probability in this tail is .05.


# create variables to filter premium and very good cuts
# look at mean and standard deviation to see how similar they are 
# for premium cut

# calculate one-sided t-test
# Confidence level: 95%
# For one-sided tests, the order of the vectors in t.test() is

# Analysis and Conclusions
# two-sided t-test results interpretation

# Diamonds Color Null hypothesis = no statistically significant difference in means of the two sets of 
# values. p-value is less than 0.05, so null hypothesis of there being no statistically significant 
# difference between means of the sets of values is rejected. This, along with confidence 
# interval not containing zero, indicates a statistically significant difference between 
# the means of the price values of best colored diamonds vs worst colored diamonds. 
# The quality level of color of diamonds significantly affects the prices of the diamonds. 
# Color has the highest t-value of 23.121.
# one-sided t-test results interpretation

# Diamonds Cut Null hypothesis = no significant difference in means of the two sets of values. 
# p-value is less than 0.05, so null hypothesis of there being no statistically significant 
# difference between the means of the sets of values is rejected. This is a statistically 
# significant result and the confidence interval does not contain zero, indicating a statistically 
# significant difference between the means of the price values of best cut diamonds vs worst cut diamonds.
# The quality level of cut of diamonds affects the corresponding prices of the diamonds.
# t-test with factor results interpretation

# Diamonds Clarity
# Null hypothesis = no statistically significant difference in means of
# the two sets of values. p-value is less than 0.05, so null hypothesis of there
# being no statistically sigificant difference between the means of the sets of values
# is rejected. This is a statistically significant result and the confidence interval 
# does not contain zero, indicating a statistically significant difference between the means 
# of the price values of best clarity of diamonds vs worst clarity of diamonds.
# The quality level of clarity of diamonds affects the corresponding prices of the diamonds.

# Diamonds Carat
# The values of diamonds carats have been split into a lower and upper half.
# Null hypothesis = no statistically significant difference in means of the
# two sets of values. p-value is less than 0.05, so null hypothesis of there
# being no statistically sigificant difference between the means of the sets 
# of values is rejected. This is a statistically significant result and the
# confidence interval does not contain zero, indicating a statistically 
# significant difference between the means of the price values of lower 
# half of diamond carats and the upper half of diamond carats. The number of carats 
# significantly affects the corresponding prices of the diamonds. Interestingly,
# the t-value for this t-test was a negative number. The means were examined and 
# the set of values with the lower carat values has a mean that is nearly four 
# times higher than the mean of the set of values with the higher carat values.
# From the graph, it is clear that there are far more values with carats at 2.5999 
# and below than 2.6 and above. The density plot also demonstrates this. This accounts
# for the difference in mean values and the negative t-value.

# welch T-test definition by statistics how to
# t-test, Welch’s adjusted T or unequal variances t-test) is a modification of a 
# Student’s t-test to see if two sample means are significantly different.
# The modification is to the degrees of freedom used in the test, 
# which tends to increase the test power for samples with unequal variance.
# The null hypothesis for the test is that the means are equal.
# The alternate hypothesis for the test is that means are not equal.
